# CSRP
Continuity-skill-restricted Scheduling and Routing Problem: Formulation, Optimization and Implications



## Overview
We investigate a deterministic continuity-skill-restricted scheduling and routing problem (CSRP) and its stochastic variant (SCSRP) to address attended home healthcare (AHH) problem, which is a variant of classical vehicle routing problem with time windows (VRPTW). We propose a branch-price-and-cut (BPC) algorithm to solve the CSRP and a discrete-approximation-method adaption for the SCSRP.
